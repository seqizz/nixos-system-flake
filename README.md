### My system flake for Nixos + Home manager

I am able to switch at last. There are some gimmicks left, but now it's at least better than the classical way.

#### TODO

- [ ] Move all inputs to `flake.nix`, no more sha256's in random places
- [ ] Experiment with the nixos module of Home Manager (2-in-1 maybe?)
